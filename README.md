# Calculator

Class Calculator takes InputStream.  
To start calculation run start() method. It will works while InputStream hasNext or until an exit keyword that you can change using setExitWord(String exitWord) method() (standard is "/exit").  
We can define variables: a = 100 (a = b if b exists doesn't work, maybe will add later)
# Example
intput: a = 50  
intput: b = 100  
intput: a + b - 10  
output: 140  
intput: -b*    a  +1  
output: -4999  
intput: 1 - a  
output: -49  
intput: b/a  
output: 2  
intput: c = 15  
intput: b^c  
output: 10  
output: Bye!
